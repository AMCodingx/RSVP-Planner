1. General Style
Keep the layout clean, simple, and minimalistic.
Use a modern, professional color palette with subtle contrasts (avoid overly bright or distracting colors).
Apply soft shadows to elevate cards and elements instead of gradients.
Use rounded border corners for a modern feel.

2. Consistency (SOLID & DRY principles)
All pages must share the same typography, color scheme, layout spacing, and component styles.
Reuse components consistently across the app.

3. Panels & Layout
The side panel should have no border, with small right padding to keep it sleek.
Ensure alignment and spacing are consistent throughout.

4. Theme Support
Provide light and dark mode with seamless toggling.
Save the theme preference in local storage, so the user’s choice persists.

5. UI Components
Use cards, buttons, and inputs with clean edges, soft shadows, and proper padding.
Avoid clutter—only display essential elements.
